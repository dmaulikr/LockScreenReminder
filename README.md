LockScreenReminder
==================

Lock Screen Reminder is great way to remind yourself for something very important. Every time you unlock your device you will see the reminder in your wallpaper. Simple but very useful!

Note that the users have to manually select the wallpaper from the photo library application. We didn't found any API for wallpaper selection dialog.
